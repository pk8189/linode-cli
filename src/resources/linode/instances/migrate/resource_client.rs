    /// Initiate a pending host migration that has been scheduled by Linode or initiate a cross data center (DC) migration.  A list of pending migrations, if any, can be accessed from [List notifications](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-notifications). When the migration begins, your Linode will be shutdown if not already off. If the migration initiated the shutdown, it will reboot the Linode when completed.
    ///
    /// To initiate a cross DC migration, you must pass a `region` parameter to the request body specifying the target data center region. You can view a list of all available regions and their feature capabilities from [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions). See our [Pricing Page](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) for Region-specific pricing, which applies after migration is complete. If your Linode has a DC migration already queued or you have initiated a previously scheduled migration, you will not be able to initiate a DC migration until it has completed.
    ///
    /// `vpc` details
    ///
    /// - Cross DC migrations are not allowed for Linodes that have a `vpc` purpose Configuration Profile Interface. Host migrations within the same DC are permitted.
    /// - See the [VPC documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vpc/#technical-specifications) guide for its specifications and limitations.
    ///
    /// `vlan` details
    ///
    /// - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.
    /// - Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers do not support IPv6 `/116` pools or IP Failover. If you have these features enabled on your Linode and attempt to migrate to an NGN data center, the migration will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.
